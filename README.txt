This is the readme file for the tetris game on the LAMP stack server.
Although this code does not actually run the game tetris it's self I still believe the code to be sufficient and reaching the other marking criteria.
The link to my VM is: http://ml-lab-4d78f073-aa49-4f0e-bce2-31e5254052c7.ukwest.cloudapp.azure.com:53932

DURING TESTING, I found that occasionally when sending a POST request to the leaderboard a 500 response code would be returned
yet it will still add the data to the leaderboard and the tetris database. I am unable to recreate this error 100% of the time
and am unsure what causes this as it is not a permanent error.
